## Introduction
This tool implements the Virtual Elevation method ("Chung Method") developed by Robert Chung, which allows for the estimation of a cyclist's aerodynamic parameters (CdA) and rolling resistance (Crr) using power, speed and elevation data from cycling activities.

The Virtual Elevation method works by calculating what the elevation profile would look like based on the measured power output, speed, and assumed aerodynamic and rolling resistance parameters. By optimizing these parameters to make the virtual elevation match the actual measured elevation as closely as possible, we can hopefully accurately estimate a rider's CdA and Crr values.

## Features
- **FIT File Import**: Load cycling data from Garmin and other devices
- **Multiple Analysis Methods**:
  - Standard analysis with manual lap selection
  - GPS-based lap splitting for repeated laps
  - Out-and-back analysis for bi-directional courses
  - GPS gate analysis for specific course segments
- **Parameter Optimization**: Adjust CdA and Crr values with real-time visualization
- **Wind Correction**: Account for wind speed and direction in calculations
- **Map Visualization**: View GPS tracks with lap markers and analysis segments
- **Results Export**: Save analysis results to CSV with plots

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Packages
- PySide6
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- fitparse
- folium
- platformdirs

## Usage

### Starting the Application
```bash
python main.py
```

### Basic Workflow
1. **Select FIT File**: Click "Browse" to choose a cycling activity file
2. **Choose Analysis Type**: Select from available analysis methods
3. **Configure Parameters**:
   - System mass (rider + bike weight)
   - Air density (rho)
   - Fixed or variable CdA/Crr values
   - Wind conditions (optional)
4. **Select Laps**: Choose which laps to analyze
5. **Adjust Analysis**: Use sliders to fine-tune parameters and trim data
6. **Save Results**: Export analysis results and plots

### Analysis Methods

#### Standard Analysis
Basic Virtual Elevation analysis for selected laps with manual trim controls.

#### GPS Lap Splitting
Automatically detects repeated laps based on GPS position markers. Ideal for velodrome or circuit testing.

#### Out-and-Back Analysis
Specialized analysis for courses where you ride out and return on the same route. Compares outbound vs inbound segments.

#### GPS Gate Analysis
Define start/end gates for analyzing specific course segments. Supports multiple gate sets for complex courses.

## Technical Details

### Virtual Elevation Calculation
The tool calculates virtual elevation using the power balance equation:
```
Power = Aero_drag + Rolling_resistance + Gravity + Acceleration
```
